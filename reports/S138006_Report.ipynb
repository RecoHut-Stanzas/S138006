        "| Problem | Existing literature often ignores the negative feedback e.g. dislikes on YouTube videos, and only capture the homophily (or assortativity) patterns by positive feedback. This is a missed opportunity situation. |\n",
        "| Hypothesis | Performance of GNN-based Recommender Systems can be improved by including negative feedbacks. Disassortivity patterns can be learned by negative feedback. LightGCN can capture the assortativity patterns. and the MLP network can capture the disassortivity patterns. |\n",
        "| Benefits | Better performance than LightGCN. Inclusion of negative feedback in deep learning fashion is an important inspiration for the future models. |\n",
        "| Solution | Let's say I watched movie A and rated it 4 on a 1-5 scale (where 5 is the best), It indicates that I liked the movie. Next time, I watched movie B and rated it 2 on the same scale, what does this indicates? Well, it is below the average, so we can take an assumption here, just like we did in the first case, that anything below (resp. above) an average (or a number n in general) would indicate that the user didn't liked (resp. liked) the movie. SiRen leverages this core assumption to provide the recommendation to users. It first constructs a signed bipartite graph ⁍. Then it split this into 2 graphs. ⁍, and ⁍. The purpose of this graph partitioning is to make the graphs ⁍ and ⁍, respectively, assortative and disassortative so that each partitioned graph is used as input to the most appropriate learning model. |\n",

        "| Preprocessing | We remove users/items that have less than 20 interaction in Amazon-Books and Yelp. For fair comparison, the test set consists of only the ratings of 4 and 5 as the ground truth set. |\n",
